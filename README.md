# FizzBuzz Exercise

Fizz Buzz is a simple coding exercise used for interviewing potential software developers.
The instructions for the basic  implementation of this exercise are:
> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 each on a new line.
> For multiples of three print "Fizz"
> For multiples of five print "Buzz"
> For multiple of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
> For extra credit write an implementation that uses dynamic values for the multiples of Fizz, Buzz and FizzBuzz


- Write the FizzBuzz logic in the src/FizzBuzz class.

- Run `npm run start` to start a development server.

- Run `npm run test` to see if the exercise is solved.
